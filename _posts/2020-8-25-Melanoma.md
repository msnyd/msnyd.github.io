title: A Dive into Melanoma Classification with Machine Learning

Skin cancer is the most prevalent type of cancer. Melanoma, specifically, is responsible for 75% of skin cancer deaths, despite being the least common skin cancer. The American Cancer Society estimates over 100,000 new melanoma cases will be diagnosed in 2020. It's also expected that almost 7,000 people will die from the disease. As with other cancers, early and accurate detection—potentially aided by data science—can make treatment more effective.

In this competition I competed in, we need to identify melanoma in images of skin lesions. This is a very challenging image classification task as seen by looking at the sample images below. Can you recognize the differences between images? Below are example of skin images with and without melanoma.
