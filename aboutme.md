My name is Matthew Snyder,

While my history with coding goes a ways back, I just started taking seriously in the middle of 2019. I started my own game and then soon started working towards the path of a data scientist. I signed up for Lambda School at the end of last year for the Data Scientist path and I recently graduated.  Since then I have been applying to jobs and competeing in Kaggle competitions.  I will show my progress in the posts however it takes time to update.
