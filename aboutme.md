My name is Matthew Snyder,

While my history with coding goes a ways back, I just started taking seriously in the middle of 2019. I started my own game and then soon started working towards the path of a data scientist. I signed up for Lambda School at the end of last year for the Data Scientist path and I recently graduated.  Since then I have been applying to jobs and competeing in Kaggle competitions.  I will show my progress in the posts however they take time to make so it isn't always 100% up to date. 

Thanks for reading a bit about myself! If you would like to contact me about a job offer or a inquiry, you can find my contact information below or click the links at the bottom of the page!
